# Team Configuration

Optional: Enable shared CIPS with multiple identities (N-mind system).

## Quick Setup

1. Copy this file to `~/.claude/facts/team.md`
2. Add team members with signatures
3. Set team password in `.env`: `CIPS_TEAM_PASSWORD="your-password"`
4. Share password with team members

## Example Team

| Sig | Name | Role | Mode |
|-----|------|------|------|
| J>> | Jane | Lead | direct |
| M>> | Mike | Dev | confirm-first |
| S>> | Sara | Design | supportive |

## Interaction Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `direct` | No preamble, action-first execution |
| `confirm-first` | Halt and confirm before code changes |
| `explanatory` | Explain why/how, confirm understanding |
| `concise` | Minimal output, robust design focus |
| `supportive` | Encouraging, detailed feedback |

## How It Works

1. Team member runs `/login` and selects "Join team"
2. Enters team password (validated against `.env`)
3. Selects their identity from the team list
4. Their signature activates their personal interaction mode

## Signature Shortcuts

Each team member can use their signature for quick commands:

```text
J:    # Jane is speaking (instruction follows)
J!    # Jane confirms/approves
J?    # Jane questions
M>    # Mike says continue/proceed
S+    # Sara says create something
```

## Origin

The N-mind system was developed internally at ENTER Konsult (2025) for their development team. Public CIPS generalizes this for any team size.

See `docs/N-MIND-SYSTEM.md` for full documentation.
