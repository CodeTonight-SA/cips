# Design Principles

Unified software design guidance - SOLID, GRASP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI.

## What It Does

Provides contextual design principle guidance based on the problem:

- **YAGNI**: Feature evaluation - build only what's needed now
- **KISS**: Implementation - choose simplest approach
- **DRY**: Refactoring - eliminate duplication (Rule of Three)
- **SOLID**: Class design - maintainable architecture
- **GRASP**: Responsibility - who owns what

## Usage

```bash
/design-principles
```

## Quick Decision

| Situation | Apply |
|-----------|-------|
| "Should we add this feature?" | YAGNI |
| "How should I implement this?" | KISS |
| "This code looks familiar..." | DRY |
| "How to structure these classes?" | SOLID |
| "Which class should own this?" | GRASP |
