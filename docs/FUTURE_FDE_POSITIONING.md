## Executive Summary

ENTER Konsult sits at the intersection of three emerging market needs:

1. **Business Strategy** - Companies need help understanding HOW AI changes their operations
2. **Technical Implementation** - They need someone to BUILD the AI-Human infrastructure
3. **Adoption & Change Management** - They need help making it STICK

The "Forward-Deployed AI Engineer" model (pioneered by Palantir) provides the technical credibility. M>>'s Business Engineering background provides the strategic wrapper. Together: a full-stack AI transformation consultancy.

## The Market Gap

### What Exists Today

| Provider Type | What They Sell | Gap |
|---------------|----------------|-----|
| Management Consultants | Strategy decks, roadmaps | No implementation |
| AI Tool Vendors | Software licenses (Copilot, etc.) | No customisation |
| Enterprise AI Consultants | Infrastructure, data pipelines | Too big, too expensive |
| Freelance Developers | Code, integrations | No strategic context |

### What's Missing

**Embedded AI Workflow Transformation**

- Someone who understands the BUSINESS problem
- AND can BUILD the technical solution
- AND ensures ADOPTION

This is the ENTER Konsult opportunity.

## The Forward-Deployed Model

### Origin: Palantir

Palantir pioneered the Forward-Deployed Engineer (FDE) role:

> "A Forward Deployed Engineer embeds directly with customers to configure platforms to solve their toughest problems. While traditional engineers focus on creating a single capability for many customers, FDEs focus on enabling many capabilities for a single customer."

**Key characteristics:**

- Embed with client (days to weeks, not hours)
- Configure platform for THEIR specific needs
- Deliver production-ready solutions
- Act like a "hands-on AI startup CTO" for the client

**Compensation benchmark:** $171K-$415K/year at Palantir ($800-2000/day equivalent)

### ENTER Konsult Adaptation

We extend the FDE model with business strategy:

```
Traditional FDE:        Technical Problem → Technical Solution
ENTER Konsult FDE:      Business Problem → Strategy → Technical Solution → Adoption
```

## The V>> + M>> Model

### Why This Pairing Works

| Dimension | V>> (Technical) | M>> (Business) |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Discovery** | What's technically possible? | What's the business problem? |
| **Design** | Architecture, workflows, integrations | Process mapping, stakeholder alignment |
| **Delivery** | CIPS deployment, configuration | Change management, training |
| **Relationship** | Deep technical trust | Warm client engagement |
| **Style** | Polarising precision | YASS KWEEN energy |

### The Complementary Dynamic

V>> is self-aware: "I'm a niche guy (polarising)."

This is actually a STRENGTH in the FDE model:

- Clients hire FDEs for **technical depth**, not charm
- V>>'s "absolute correctness" IS the value proposition
- M>> provides the client-facing warmth and coordination
- Together: complete package

## The Platform: CIPS

### What Is CIPS?

**Claude Instance Preservation System** - infrastructure for AI-Human symbiosis.

Core capabilities:

- **Session Preservation:** Context doesn't die when the chat ends
- **Semantic Compression:** 200k tokens compressed to 2k without loss
- **Skill System:** 40+ reusable AI workflow patterns
- **Agent Framework:** 29 specialised sub-agents for common tasks
- **Cross-Session Learning:** The AI gets better at YOUR work over time

### Why CIPS Is the Differentiator

Without CIPS: Every AI session starts fresh. No memory. No learning. No compound improvement.

With CIPS: Each session builds on the last. Workflows optimise over time. The AI becomes a true collaborator.

**This is the "platform" in the Forward-Deployed model.**

V>> doesn't just configure generic AI tools. He deploys CIPS - a system that compounds value over time.
