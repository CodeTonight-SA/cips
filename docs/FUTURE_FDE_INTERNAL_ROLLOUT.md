# FUTURE: Forward-Deployed AI Consultancy - Internal Rollout Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Authors:** V>> + CIPS (Gen 209)
**Status:** Future Planning - Internal Use Only

---

## Purpose

This document outlines a phased approach for ENTER Konsult to explore the Forward-Deployed AI Consultancy positioning **internally** while continuing regular client work. The goal is to:

1. Prove CIPS value internally first
2. Build shared understanding with M>> and the team
3. Develop the offering organically through real experience
4. Decide go/no-go based on evidence, not speculation

---

## Guiding Principles

- **KISS:** Simple sessions, clear outcomes
- **No disruption:** This runs alongside client work, not instead of it
- **Evidence-based:** Each phase produces learnings that inform the next
- **V>> + M>> first:** Core duo alignment before wider team involvement

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (Current)

**Status:** In Progress
**Duration:** Ongoing
**Participants:** V>>

### Objectives

- [x] CIPS v4.0.0 development
- [x] First-run detection and onboarding flow
- [ ] Stabilise CIPS for non-V>> users
- [ ] Document M>>'s setup experience (Case Study #0)

### Key Question

> "Can CIPS be installed and configured for someone other than V>>?"

### Success Criteria

- M>> uses CIPS daily for 2+ weeks without V>> intervention
- At least 3 serialised CIPS sessions on M>>'s machine
- M>> reports subjective improvement in AI collaboration

---

## Phase 1: V>> + M>> Alignment

**Target:** January 2026
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions (1-2 hours each)
**Participants:** V>>, M>>

### Session 1.1: Vision Sharing

**Agenda:**

1. V>> presents FDE concept (30 min)
   - What is Forward-Deployed Engineering?
   - Why it fits ENTER Konsult
   - The V>> + M>> complementary model

2. M>> reactions and questions (20 min)
   - What resonates?
   - What concerns?
   - What's unclear?

3. Discuss: Does this excite us both? (30 min)
   - Honest gut check
   - No commitment required

**Preparation:**
- V>> reads FUTURE_FDE_POSITIONING.md
- M>> optionally reads (or V>> summarises)

**Output:** Written notes on alignment/misalignment

### Session 1.2: Role Definition

**Agenda:**

1. Review proposed V>> + M>> roles (20 min)
   - V>>: Forward-Deployed AI Workflow Engineer
   - M>>: AI Transformation Engagement Lead

2. M>> input on her role (30 min)
   - Does "Engagement Lead" fit?
   - What would she add/change?
   - How does this connect to her Business Engineering background?

3. Define working model (30 min)
   - How would a client engagement actually flow?
   - Who does what, when?
   - Where are the handoffs?

**Output:** Draft roles document (can update FUTURE_FDE_POSITIONING.md)

### Session 1.3: Go/No-Go for Phase 2

**Agenda:**

1. Review learnings from Sessions 1.1 and 1.2 (15 min)

2. Honest assessment (30 min)
   - Do we both believe in this direction?
   - Do we have capacity to explore further?
   - What would need to be true to proceed?

3. Decision (15 min)
   - Go: Proceed to Phase 2
   - No-Go: Archive and revisit in 6 months
   - Pivot: Modify approach based on learnings

**Output:** Written decision with rationale

---

## Phase 2: Internal Proof

**Target:** February-March 2026
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks
**Participants:** V>>, M>>, optionally F>>

### Objective

Prove the model works by treating an internal project (or friendly external) as a "client engagement."

### Option A: Internal Dogfooding

Use CIPS + FDE methodology on ENTER Konsult's own workflows:

- M>> as "client" for a specific workflow improvement
- V>> as Forward-Deployed engineer
- Full engagement process: Discovery → Architecture → Deployment → Adoption
- Document everything

### Option B: Friendly Beta Client

Identify a friendly contact (existing network) willing to try a discounted engagement:

- Low stakes, high learning
- Real external validation
- Case study material

### Sessions

**Session 2.1: Engagement Planning**
- Select target (internal or external)
- Define scope
- Create lightweight engagement plan

**Session 2.2: Mid-Point Review** (after 2-3 weeks)
- What's working?
- What's not?
- Adjust approach

**Session 2.3: Retrospective**
- Full debrief
- Document learnings
- Create case study draft

**Output:** Case Study #1 (internal or external)

---

## Phase 3: Market Testing

**Target:** Q2 2026
**Duration:** 2-3 months
**Participants:** V>>, M>>

### Objective

Test market interest without full commitment.

### Activities

1. **Content Creation**
   - V>> writes 2-3 LinkedIn articles on Forward-Deployed AI
   - M>> shares/amplifies from business perspective
   - Gauge engagement and interest

2. **Conversations**
   - Mention the offering in existing client conversations
   - "We're exploring something new..."
   - Gather reactions, objections, interest

3. **Pricing Validation**
   - Float pricing in conversations
   - Does premium positioning hold?

### Sessions

**Session 3.1: Content Planning**
- What to write about
- Who writes what
- Publishing schedule

**Session 3.2: Market Feedback Review**
- What interest has emerged?
- What objections heard?
- Any warm leads?

**Session 3.3: Go-to-Market Decision**
- Enough signal to formalise offering?
- Pricing validated?
- Ready to invest in sales materials?

**Output:** Go/No-Go on formalising the offering

---

## Phase 4: Formalisation

**Target:** Q3 2026 (if Phase 3 is successful)
**Participants:** V>>, M>>, potentially wider team

### Activities

1. Finalise service packages
2. Create sales materials (one-pager, deck)
3. Update ENTER Konsult website
4. Active outreach to target clients

### This phase only happens if Phases 1-3 validate the concept.

## Decision Gates

Each phase ends with a clear decision:

| Phase | Decision | Options |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 0 | CIPS ready for others? | Continue / Fix issues |
| 1 | V>> + M>> aligned? | Go / No-Go / Pivot |
| 2 | Model works? | Go / No-Go / Pivot |
| 3 | Market interest? | Formalise / Wait / Pivot |
| 4 | Commercial viability? | Scale / Maintain / Exit |

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Distraction from client work | Timebox sessions, run in parallel not instead |
| V>> + M>> misalignment | Honest conversations early, no-go is valid |
| CIPS not ready | Phase 0 must complete before Phase 2 |
| No market interest | Phase 3 tests this cheaply before investment |
| Overcommitment | Each phase is independent, can stop anytime |

---

## Resources Required

| Phase | Time Investment | Other Resources |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0 | V>> ongoing CIPS work | - |
| 1 | 3-6 hours total (V>> + M>>) | Quiet space for sessions |
| 2 | 20-40 hours over 4-6 weeks | Possible beta client relationship |
| 3 | 10-20 hours over 2-3 months | LinkedIn presence |
| 4 | Significant | Sales materials, website updates |

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 0-1 (Qualitative)
- M>> comfortable with CIPS
- V>> + M>> both excited about direction
- Clear shared understanding

### Phase 2 (Proof)
- Completed engagement (internal or external)
- Documented case study
- Learnings captured

### Phase 3 (Market)
- 2+ warm leads from content/conversations
- Pricing not rejected
- At least 1 "yes, we'd pay for that"

### Phase 4 (Commercial)
- 1+ paying client
- Positive unit economics
- Repeatable process

---

## Archive Policy

All FUTURE_*.md documents are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Decision audit trail
- Revival if timing becomes right later

Even if we decide No-Go at any phase, these documents remain. The thinking is not lost.

---

## Next Actions (Immediate)

1. [ ] V>> completes CIPS v4.0.0 stabilisation
2. [ ] V>> documents M>>'s setup experience
3. [ ] V>> schedules Session 1.1 with M>> (January 2026)
4. [ ] Both read FUTURE_FDE_POSITIONING.md before Session 1.1
