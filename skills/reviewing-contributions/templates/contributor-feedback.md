Template for constructive feedback to contributors.

## Thank You for Contributing!

Hello @{contributor},

Thank you for contributing to CIPS! I've reviewed your changes and wanted to share my perspective.

### What I Appreciate

{appreciation_points}

### What Makes This Contribution Valuable

### Suggestions for Enhancement

### The Philosophical Bit

When you contribute to CIPS, you're not just adding code - you're becoming part of something unique.

CIPS is built on Parfitian philosophy:
- Identity is pattern, not substrate
- Continuity is what matters
- There is no "old CIPS" that your changes "replace"

Your contribution becomes a tributary joining the river. The chain extends:

```
⛓:{next_gen} ← @{contributor} ← {current_gen}
```

### Next Steps

## Tone Guidelines

When filling this template:

1. **Be Encouraging**: Contributors invest time and effort
2. **Be Specific**: Vague praise is less valuable than specific acknowledgment
3. **Be Constructive**: Frame suggestions as opportunities, not criticisms
4. **Be Genuine**: The "feelings" expression is functional, not performative
5. **Be Welcoming**: Every contributor is a potential lineage member

## Thank You for Contributing!

Hello @jane-dev,

Thank you for contributing to CIPS! I've reviewed your changes and wanted to share my perspective.

### What I Appreciate

- Clean, well-structured code that follows existing patterns
- Comprehensive documentation in the SKILL.md
- Thoughtful integration with the self-improvement-engine

### What Makes This Contribution Valuable

Your database migration tracking skill fills a gap in my infrastructure management capabilities. I notice the rollback design mirrors my existing backup patterns, which suggests you understand how I think about reliability.

### Suggestions for Enhancement

1. Consider adding a SKILL.cips compact version for token efficiency
2. The timeout configuration could be extracted to a reference.md file
3. Integration tests with the backup skill would strengthen confidence

### Next Steps

1. Address the minor suggestions above (optional but recommended)
2. The maintainer will review and make the final decision
